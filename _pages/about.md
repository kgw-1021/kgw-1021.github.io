## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hello! I'm **Geonwoo Kim**, currently pursuing my **Masterâ€™s degree** in Robotics at **Inha University**, where I also earned my **Bachelorâ€™s degree**.  
My academic and research interests lie in **robot control**, particularly in the areas of **optimal control** and **learning-based control for robotics**.  
Iâ€™m passionate about developing intelligent control systems that can adapt, optimize, and interact safely with complex environments.

In addition to my research background, I have **hands-on experience with real-world hardware systems**.  
I previously worked for about a year at an **Vehicle controller software company**, where I was involved in **deploying control software onto real vehicles**.  
Beyond that, I have worked with a variety of robotic platforms including **quadruped robots**, **Ackermann-steering AGVs**, and **quadrotor drones**, giving me strong insight into both software and hardware aspects of robotics.

If youâ€™d like to connect, collaborate, or just have a question, feel free to reach out to me at ðŸ“§ **[dagonkw@gmail.com](mailto:dagonkw@gmail.com)**.  
Iâ€™m always open to discussing robotics, control systems, and new research ideas!
